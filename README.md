KanColleTool Viewer
===================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/KanColleTool/kct-viewer.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/KanColleTool/kct-viewer)

**KanColleTool Viewer** (aka **KCTV**) is a wrapper around KanColle, and a part of [KanColleTool](https://github.com/KanColleTool/KanColleTool).

It's basically a less shitty Flash Player Standalone (aka Flash Projector) with KanColle-specific optimizations and some extra features, the main ones being on-the-fly translation of in-game text and data collection for the [tool](https://github.com/KanColleTool/kct-tool).
