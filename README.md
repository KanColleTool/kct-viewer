KanColleTool Viewer
===================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/KanColleTool/kct-viewer.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/KanColleTool/kct-viewer)

This is the viewer for [KanColleTool](https://github.com/KanColleTool/kct-tool).

It allows players to stream data directly from the client instead of getting information from the DMM servers directly, which could lead to a ban.

The viewer can also translate the game on-the-fly by modifying server response text
